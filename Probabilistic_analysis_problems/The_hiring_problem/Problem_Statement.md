# The Hiring Problem

We need to hire a office assistant using an employment agency.

It sends one applicant at a time and costs a fixed amount if you hire a candidate.

You hire the candidate in one condition ie. if the new candidate is more qualified than the current assistant.

If you hire the new assistant you fire the current assistant and submit the hiring fees to the agency.

**Aim** - To minimize the cost of hiring a assistant.
